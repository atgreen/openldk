# OpenLDK Test Failure Analysis

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Test Run:** After thread synchronization fixes

## Summary
- Total FAIL (unexpected): **7** → **5** (after thread sync fixes)

- Total UNRESOLVED: **0**
- Overall test success rate: **Very High**

## Update - After Thread Synchronization Fixes
**FIXED (3 of 7):**
- ✅ PR6204 - Now passes (fixed by thread synchronization work)
- ✅ PR12416 - Now passes (fixed by thread synchronization work)

**REMAINING (4 of 7):**

- ❌ md5test - Timeout/hang
- ❌ PR36252 - Timeout/hang
- ⚠️  Thread_Wait - Partial implementation (wait/notify added but has single-CV issue)

## Update - After Object.wait/notify Implementation (Session 7)
**FIXED (4 of 7):**
- ✅ Thread_Wait - Now passes! (wait/notify fully implemented)
- Previous 3 tests remain passing

**REMAINING (3 of 7):**
- ❌ err1 - NullPointerException not caught
- ❌ md5test - Timeout/hang
- ❌ PR36252 - Timeout/hang

## Session Notes - Object.wait/notify Implementation

**Final Implementation:**
- Added IllegalMonitorStateException stub class to bootstrap.lisp
- Fixed make-image to kill Java threads before core save (SBCL limitation)
- Full Object.wait(J), notify(), and notifyAll() methods in native.lisp
- Added wait-set slot to <java-monitor> for explicit wait-set tracking
- Added thread completion waiting logic in main() to wait for non-daemon threads
- Added output buffer flushing before program exit

**Architecture - Single CV with Wait-Set Tracking:**
The implementation uses a single condition variable (matching JVM ObjectMonitor design) with explicit wait-set list tracking:
1. Monitor entry/exit: Threads loop on CV while owner != nil
2. Object.wait/notify: Threads added to wait-set, loop on CV while in wait-set
3. notify(): Removes thread from wait-set, broadcasts CV
4. Waiting thread wakes, sees it's not in wait-set, proceeds to re-acquire monitor

**Key Bug Fixes:**
1. **Stub Override**: Found stub notify/notifyAll methods that were overriding real implementation
2. **Output Flushing**: Programs exited before thread output flushed - added sleep + finish-output

**Test Results:**
- ✅ TestWait0 - PASS (separate lock object)
- ✅ TestWaitThis - PASS (using 'this' as lock)
- ✅ Thread_Wait - PASS (GCJ test suite)
- All wait/notify synchronization working correctly

## Failure Details

### HIGH Priority (P1) - Fix These Next

#### 1. **gcj/PR6204.java** - DESTRUCTURING-BIND parsing error
**Error:**
```
Error while parsing arguments to DESTRUCTURING-BIND:
too few elements in () to satisfy lambda list (METHOD . NEXT)
```
**Category:** Bytecode parsing/compiler bug
**Impact:** Internal compiler error - affects correctness
**Root Cause:** Bug in method descriptor parsing
**Effort:** Likely quick fix once identified

#### 2. **gcj/PR36252.java** - Timeout (infinite loop)
**Error:** `WARNING: program timed out`
**Category:** Runtime bug/infinite loop
**Impact:** Code hangs completely
**Root Cause:** Likely threading issue or loop bug
**Effort:** Requires debugging to find hang location

#### 3. **gcj/Thread_Wait.java** - Missing wait(J) method
**Error:**
```
The function OPENLDK::|wait(J)| is undefined
WARNING: program timed out
```
**Category:** Threading/synchronization
**Impact:** Core threading primitive missing
**Root Cause:** Object.wait(long) native method not implemented
**Effort:** Need to implement native method

#### 4. **gcj/PR12416.java** - Class precedence circularity
**Error:**
```
It is not possible to compute the class precedence list because
there are circularities in the local precedence relations.
The class named OPENLDK::B appears in the supers of the class named OPENLDK::C.
The class named OPENLDK::|java/lang/Object| appears in the supers of the class named OPENLDK::A.
```
**Category:** Class hierarchy/CLOS integration
**Impact:** Cannot load certain complex class hierarchies
**Root Cause:** Java interface linearization doesn't map cleanly to CLOS
**Effort:** May need CLOS workaround or custom CPL algorithm

### MEDIUM Priority (P2)

#### 5. **gcj/PR242.java** - Undefined function someNum()
**Error:** `The function OPENLDK::|someNum()| is undefined.`
**Category:** Method resolution
**Impact:** Method not found/compiled
**Root Cause:** Likely interface default method or static method issue
**Effort:** Need to investigate method lookup

#### 6. **gcj/err1.java** - NullPointerException not caught
**Error:** `Condition OPENLDK::|condition-java/lang/NullPointerException| was signalled.`
**Category:** Exception handling
**Impact:** Exceptions not being caught properly
**Root Cause:** Exception catching mechanism incomplete
**Effort:** Need to debug exception handler

### LOW Priority (P3)

#### 7. **gcj/md5test.java** - AssertionError
**Error:** `Condition OPENLDK::|condition-java/lang/AssertionError| was signalled.`
**Category:** Assertion/testing infrastructure
**Impact:** Java assertions not working
**Root Cause:** Assertion handling not implemented
**Effort:** Low priority - assertions are optional

## Root Cause Categories

1. **Threading/Synchronization (2 failures)**
   - Thread_Wait - missing Object.wait(long)
   - PR36252 - possible threading bug causing hang

2. **Compiler/Parser Bugs (1 failure)**
   - PR6204 - DESTRUCTURING-BIND error

3. **Class/Type System (1 failure)**
   - PR12416 - CLOS class precedence circularity

4. **Method Resolution (1 failure)**
   - PR242 - undefined function

5. **Exception Handling (1 failure)**
   - err1 - NullPointerException not caught

6. **Assertions (1 failure)**
   - md5test - AssertionError handling

## Recommended Work Order

1. **PR6204** - Fix DESTRUCTURING-BIND bug (likely quick fix, high impact)
2. **Thread_Wait** - Implement Object.wait(long) native method
3. **PR36252** - Debug timeout/infinite loop
4. **PR12416** - Handle class precedence circularity
5. **PR242** - Fix method resolution
6. **err1** - Fix exception catching
7. **md5test** - Fix assertion handling

## Expected Failures (XFAIL) - 118 total

Most XFAILs fall into these categories:
- **Threading tests** - Many threading primitives not yet implemented
- **Process/IO tests** - Process spawning not implemented
- **AWT/GUI tests** - Graphics not implemented (out of scope)
- **Serialization** - Object serialization incomplete
- **Stack traces** - Stack trace generation incomplete
- **Bytecode verification** - "Stack depth mismatch" errors indicate verification issues
