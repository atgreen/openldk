# Development Session Notes - 2025-01-03

## Summary

Performed comprehensive code review and fixed several issues in the OpenLDK codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation

**Created HACKING.md**
- Documented JIT compilation flow
- Explained static class instance handling
- Clarified stack variable merging (side-effect based, not a bug)
- Added debug flag reference
- Listed common pitfall patterns
- Included testing strategies

**Created TODO.md**
- Organized tasks by priority
- Listed immediate priorities (test failures, code quality)
- Documented core features to implement
- Added infrastructure tasks

**Updated AGENTS.md**
- Added cross-references to HACKING.md and TODO.md
- Added JDK8 source reference location

### 2. Code Fixes

**Fixed type comparison (src/basic-block.lisp:306-307)**
- Changed `(eq (type-of last-insn) 'ir-goto)` to `(typep last-insn 'ir-goto)`
- Changed `(eq target-address offset)` to `(eql target-address offset)`
- Rationale: typep is robust to class redefinition; eql handles bignums correctly

**Added stack depth assertion (src/bc-to-ir.lisp:1947-1950)**
- Added assertion to detect stack depth mismatches during merge
- Helps catch bytecode verification rule violations early
- Makes debugging easier than silent truncation

### 3. Code Clarification

**Added comments to stack merging (src/openldk.lisp:255-259)**
- Explained that merge-stacks relies on side effects
- Documented that return value is intentionally discarded
- Clarified mutation of shared stack-variable objects

**Updated merge-stacks docstring (src/bc-to-ir.lisp:1944-1946)**
- Noted side-effect nature explicitly
- Explained mutation of var-numbers slot
- Clarified that returned list is not the primary output

### 4. CLI Improvements

**Added graceful error handling (src/openldk.lisp:681-694)**
- Catches cli:wrong-number-of-args when MAINCLASS missing
- Displays helpful usage message instead of stack trace
- Catches general errors and displays them cleanly

## Code Review Findings

### Issues Fixed
- ✅ Type comparison using eq instead of typep
- ✅ Number comparison using eq instead of eql
- ✅ Stack depth mismatch could silently truncate

### Non-Issues (Initially Misidentified)
- ❌ Stack merging "not storing result" - Actually correct! Uses side effects.
- ❌ Undefined variable warnings - Expected, symbols created at class load time

### Remaining Issues
- Undefined function warnings (expected - methods defined dynamically)
- Style warning about &OPTIONAL and &KEY in same lambda list (cosmetic)

## Testing

Test suite launched in background (make check).
Results will be in `testsuite/test-results.log`.

Expected from README:
- ~8,839 passing tests
- 11 unexpected failures (need investigation)
- 1,712 expected failures

## Next Steps

1. Analyze test results when complete
2. Investigate the 11 unexpected failures
3. Consider implementing bytecode verification
4. Review native method implementations for completeness
5. Test with real-world Java libraries

## Technical Learnings

### Stack Variable Merging Algorithm

The merge-stacks function is subtle:
1. Stack variables are shared CLOS objects across all IR references
2. Merging mutates the var-numbers slot to include union of all paths
3. Because objects are shared, mutations propagate automatically
4. Return value is discarded - side effects do the work

This is more efficient than creating new objects and updating all references.

### Static Class Instances

Java static members mapped to CLOS:
```lisp
(defparameter |+static-java/lang/System+|
  (make-instance '|java/lang/System|))
```

Created at class load time, referenced throughout code.
Compile-time undefined warnings are expected and harmless.

### Exception Handling Integration

Exceptions integrated into control flow graph:
- Exception table entries create basic block boundaries
- Handler PC becomes block start
- Exception object pushed as ir-condition-exception
- HANDLER-CASE wraps exception handler blocks

## Commits Made

1. `f644d06` - Add graceful error handling for missing CLI arguments
2. `297d4d4` - Add TODO.md with development roadmap
3. `290bf78` - Add JDK8 source reference to AGENTS.md
4. `5c4c759` - Add HACKING.md with critical architecture knowledge
5. `d2e5d5e` - Add clarifying comments to stack merging side-effect behavior
6. `c4205ac` - Add cross-references to HACKING.md and TODO.md in AGENTS.md
7. `db49a78` - Fix type comparison to use typep instead of eq type-of
8. `dc2ff83` - Add assertion to detect stack depth mismatches
9. `bc13b47` - Update TODO.md with completed tasks

All commits passed linting (ocicl lint openldk.asd).

## Test Suite Status (In Progress)

Test suite launched at 21:42, currently running for ~20 minutes.

**Current Results (as of ~22:02):**
- 380+ PASS (expected passes)
- 80+ XFAIL (expected failures - known issues)
- 1 FAIL (unexpected failure):
  - `gcj/PR36252.java execution test` - TIMEOUT
    - Test for MS932 (Japanese) character encoding
    - String constructor with encoding appears to hang/loop
    - Not in expected-failures.txt, so this is a new issue

**Expected Final Results (from README):**
- 8,839 expected passes
- 11 unexpected failures
- 1,712 expected failures
- 11 unresolved testcases

Currently at ~470 results out of ~10,500+ expected total.
Test suite still running through jikestst, then will run mauve (the bulk of tests).

## Repository State

Branch: master
Status: 9 commits ahead of origin/master
Working tree: Clean
Next: Continue monitoring test results, analyze when complete
