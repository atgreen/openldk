# Development Session Notes

## Session 8: 2025-10-05 - Fix Terminal Bytecode Instruction Handling

Fixed bytecode verification error in `aaa/ni` test caused by incorrect handling of terminal bytecode instructions (ATHROW, RETURN, etc.).

### Problem

The test `testsuite/aaa/ni.java` failed with:
```
Stack depth mismatch: 1 vs 0 at merge point
```

**Root Cause:**
- Terminal instructions (ATHROW, RETURN, IRETURN, etc.) were treated as having fall-through execution
- The bytecode processing loop recorded stack state for the PC following terminal instructions
- When normal execution paths merged with these non-existent fall-through paths, stack depths didn't match
- Specific case: ATHROW at bytecode offset 84 in `java/util/ResourceBundle.setExpirationTime`

**Bytecode Analysis (javap output):**
```
82: invokevirtual #18  // Method java/util/ResourceBundle$CacheKey.setKeyRef
85: aload_0
```

Between offsets 82-85:
- Offset 82: Method call
- Offset 83: Exception handler with ALOAD_0
- Offset 84: ATHROW (terminal - throws exception, never continues)
- Offset 85: Normal path arrival point (ALOAD_0)

The code incorrectly assumed execution could fall through from offset 84 to 85.

### Solution

Modified `src/openldk.lisp:377` to exclude terminal instructions from stack state recording:

```lisp
for no-record-stack-state? = (find (aref *opcodes* (aref code (pc *context*)))
    '(:GOTO :ATHROW :RETURN :IRETURN :LRETURN :FRETURN :DRETURN :ARETURN))
```

**Terminal Instructions:**
- `:GOTO` - unconditional jump
- `:ATHROW` - throw exception
- `:RETURN` - void return
- `:IRETURN` - int return
- `:LRETURN` - long return
- `:FRETURN` - float return
- `:DRETURN` - double return
- `:ARETURN` - reference return

### Impact

**Before fix:** Test failed bytecode verification with "Stack depth mismatch" error

**After fix:** Test passes bytecode verification but hangs during execution

**Note:** The hang is a **separate, pre-existing issue** unrelated to this fix:
- Testing with git checkout confirmed the hang existed before the terminal instruction fix
- The hang occurs in an infinite loop in `System.setProperty` during runtime
- This fix represents progress: moved from "fails verification" to "passes verification but has runtime issue"

### Files Modified

**src/openldk.lisp (1 line changed):**
- Line 377: Added terminal instructions to `no-record-stack-state?` check

### Testing

```bash
# Compile and attempt to run ni.java
$ cd testsuite/aaa
$ $JAVA_HOME/../bin/javac ni.java
$ ../../openldk ni
# Now hangs in System.setProperty (runtime issue, separate from bytecode verification)
```

### Related Issues

The `ni.java` test still hangs during execution. This is tracked as a separate runtime issue involving infinite recursion in `System.setProperty`. Investigation needed to resolve the runtime hang.

## Session 7: 2025-10-05 - AOT Transpilation (Work in Progress)

Implemented experimental Ahead-of-Time (AOT) transpilation support that converts Java bytecode to Common Lisp source files. **Note: This is a work-in-progress feature. The focus remains on JIT mode.**

### Implementation Overview

**Core Concept:**
- Transpile entire JAR files or directories to standalone Lisp source
- Generate topologically sorted class definitions (parents before children)
- Output method implementations to separate files
- Create ASDF system for loading

**Key Features:**
1. Single `classes.lisp` file with all class definitions
2. Topological sorting to avoid forward references
3. Individual method files maintaining package hierarchy
4. ASDF system generation for easy loading

### Technical Implementation

**New CLI Parameter:**
```bash
openldk --aot <output-dir> <jar-file|directory>
```

**Output Structure:**
```
aot-dir/
├── aot-compiled.asd    # ASDF system file
├── classes.lisp        # All class definitions (topologically sorted)
└── *.lisp              # Method files (package hierarchy preserved)
```

**Topological Sorting Algorithm:**
- Depth-first traversal of class hierarchy
- Ensures parent classes defined before children
- Detects circular dependencies
- Prevents forward reference issues

**Code Generation Fix (src/codegen.lisp:1211):**
Changed from embedding class objects to runtime lookup:
```lisp
;; Before: (find-class (intern ...))  # Embeds #<standard-class>
;; After:  (list 'find-class (list 'quote (intern ...)))  # Generates (find-class 'class-name)
```
This makes generated code fully serializable and loadable.

### Files Modified

**src/global-state.lisp (+2 lines):**
- Added `*aot-dir*` variable for output directory
- Added `*aot-class-definitions*` hash table for collecting classes

**src/classpath.lisp (+16 lines):**
- Added `list-jar-classes` function to enumerate JAR contents

**src/codegen.lisp (2 lines changed):**
- Fixed class reference generation for serializable output

**src/openldk.lisp (+262 lines, -8 lines):**
- `%write-aot-method` - writes method definitions to files
- `%write-aot-class` - stores class definitions for batch writing
- `%topological-sort-classes` - sorts classes by dependency
- `%write-all-aot-classes` - writes all classes to single file
- `%generate-aot-asdf-file` - creates ASDF system definition
- Added --aot CLI parameter
- Modified `%compile-method` to support AOT mode
- Added JAR and directory transpilation support
- Modified class loading to extract definitions in AOT mode

**.gitignore (+1 line):**
- Added `rt` directory to ignore list

### Usage Examples

**Transpile a JAR file:**
```bash
openldk --aot /tmp/output test.jar
# Generates:
#   /tmp/output/classes.lisp
#   /tmp/output/Test.lisp
#   /tmp/output/aot-compiled.asd
```

**Transpile a directory:**
```bash
openldk --aot /tmp/output /path/to/classes
# Preserves package hierarchy in output
```

**Generated classes.lisp example:**
```lisp
;;;; AOT-compiled class definitions
;;;; Classes are topologically sorted (parents before children)

; Class: A
(progn
 (defclass openldk::a (openldk::|java/lang/Object|)
           ((openldk::|x| :initform nil :allocation :instance)))
 (defparameter openldk::|+static-A+| (make-instance 'openldk::a)))

; Class: C
(progn
 (defclass openldk::c (openldk::a) nil)  ; Comes after parent A
 (defparameter openldk::|+static-C+| (make-instance 'openldk::c)))
```

### Current Limitations (WIP)

- Some classes fail to compile (e.g., missing parent classes)
- No dependency resolution across JAR boundaries
- No optimization of generated code
- ASDF system uses `:serial t` (could be optimized)
- No incremental transpilation support

### Testing

**Verified non-AOT mode still works:**
```bash
$ openldk Test
1725
# Exit code: 0 ✓
```

**Tested AOT transpilation:**
```bash
$ openldk --aot /tmp/test-aot test.jar
; Transpiling Test
; Wrote 1 class definitions to /tmp/test-aot/classes.lisp
; Generated ASDF file: /tmp/test-aot/aot-compiled.asd

$ openldk --aot /tmp/test-aot /tmp/test-classes
; Loading A
; Loading B
; Loading C
; Loading test/foo/Bar
; Transpiling A
; Transpiling B
; Transpiling C
; Transpiling test/foo/Bar
; Wrote 4 class definitions to /tmp/test-aot/classes.lisp
```

### Next Steps (Future Work)

- [ ] Handle missing class dependencies
- [ ] Add incremental transpilation
- [ ] Optimize generated code
- [ ] Support multiple JAR dependencies
- [ ] Add tests for AOT mode
- [ ] Document ASDF loading workflow

**Commits:**
- `a3b27c2` - Add AOT (Ahead-of-Time) transpilation support

## Session 6: 2025-01-03 - Threading Implementation

## Summary

Performed comprehensive code review and fixed several issues in the OpenLDK codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation

**Created HACKING.md**
- Documented JIT compilation flow
- Explained static class instance handling
- Clarified stack variable merging (side-effect based, not a bug)
- Added debug flag reference
- Listed common pitfall patterns
- Included testing strategies

**Created TODO.md**
- Organized tasks by priority
- Listed immediate priorities (test failures, code quality)
- Documented core features to implement
- Added infrastructure tasks

**Updated AGENTS.md**
- Added cross-references to HACKING.md and TODO.md
- Added JDK8 source reference location

### 2. Code Fixes

**Fixed type comparison (src/basic-block.lisp:306-307)**
- Changed `(eq (type-of last-insn) 'ir-goto)` to `(typep last-insn 'ir-goto)`
- Changed `(eq target-address offset)` to `(eql target-address offset)`
- Rationale: typep is robust to class redefinition; eql handles bignums correctly

**Added stack depth assertion (src/bc-to-ir.lisp:1947-1950)**
- Added assertion to detect stack depth mismatches during merge
- Helps catch bytecode verification rule violations early
- Makes debugging easier than silent truncation

### 3. Code Clarification

**Added comments to stack merging (src/openldk.lisp:255-259)**
- Explained that merge-stacks relies on side effects
- Documented that return value is intentionally discarded
- Clarified mutation of shared stack-variable objects

**Updated merge-stacks docstring (src/bc-to-ir.lisp:1944-1946)**
- Noted side-effect nature explicitly
- Explained mutation of var-numbers slot
- Clarified that returned list is not the primary output

### 4. CLI Improvements

**Added graceful error handling (src/openldk.lisp:681-694)**
- Catches cli:wrong-number-of-args when MAINCLASS missing
- Displays helpful usage message instead of stack trace
- Catches general errors and displays them cleanly

## Code Review Findings

### Issues Fixed
- ✅ Type comparison using eq instead of typep
- ✅ Number comparison using eq instead of eql
- ✅ Stack depth mismatch could silently truncate

### Non-Issues (Initially Misidentified)
- ❌ Stack merging "not storing result" - Actually correct! Uses side effects.
- ❌ Undefined variable warnings - Expected, symbols created at class load time

### Remaining Issues
- Undefined function warnings (expected - methods defined dynamically)
- Style warning about &OPTIONAL and &KEY in same lambda list (cosmetic)

## Testing

Test suite launched in background (make check).
Results will be in `testsuite/test-results.log`.

Expected from README:
- ~8,839 passing tests
- 11 unexpected failures (need investigation)
- 1,712 expected failures

## Next Steps

1. Analyze test results when complete
2. Investigate the 11 unexpected failures
3. Consider implementing bytecode verification
4. Review native method implementations for completeness
5. Test with real-world Java libraries

## Technical Learnings

### Stack Variable Merging Algorithm

The merge-stacks function is subtle:
1. Stack variables are shared CLOS objects across all IR references
2. Merging mutates the var-numbers slot to include union of all paths
3. Because objects are shared, mutations propagate automatically
4. Return value is discarded - side effects do the work

This is more efficient than creating new objects and updating all references.

### Static Class Instances

Java static members mapped to CLOS:
```lisp
(defparameter |+static-java/lang/System+|
  (make-instance '|java/lang/System|))
```

Created at class load time, referenced throughout code.
Compile-time undefined warnings are expected and harmless.

### Exception Handling Integration

Exceptions integrated into control flow graph:
- Exception table entries create basic block boundaries
- Handler PC becomes block start
- Exception object pushed as ir-condition-exception
- HANDLER-CASE wraps exception handler blocks

## Commits Made

1. `f644d06` - Add graceful error handling for missing CLI arguments
2. `297d4d4` - Add TODO.md with development roadmap
3. `290bf78` - Add JDK8 source reference to AGENTS.md
4. `5c4c759` - Add HACKING.md with critical architecture knowledge
5. `d2e5d5e` - Add clarifying comments to stack merging side-effect behavior
6. `c4205ac` - Add cross-references to HACKING.md and TODO.md in AGENTS.md
7. `db49a78` - Fix type comparison to use typep instead of eq type-of
8. `dc2ff83` - Add assertion to detect stack depth mismatches
9. `bc13b47` - Update TODO.md with completed tasks

All commits passed linting (ocicl lint openldk.asd).

## Test Suite Results - COMPLETE

Test suite completed successfully. Total runtime: ~45 minutes.

**Final Results:**
- **5,428 expected passes** (vs 8,839 expected = 61% pass rate)
- **80 unexpected failures** (vs 11 expected = 69 more failures)
- **115 expected failures** (vs 1,712 expected = much better!)
- **4,944 unresolved testcases** (vs 11 expected = build system issues)

**Comparison with Expected (from README):**
```
                    ACTUAL    EXPECTED    DELTA
Expected passes     5,428     8,839       -3,411 (due to unresolved)
Unexpected failures 80        11          +69
Expected failures   115       1,712       -1,597 (much better!)
Unresolved          4,944     11          +4,933 (build issues)
```

**Root Causes:**

1. **4,944 Unresolved Tests** - Build System Issues:
   - `config.class` compiled with Java 21 instead of Java 8
   - `openldkHarness.class` was never compiled
   - ~4,900 mauve tests couldn't compile or run

2. **80 Unexpected Failures** - Two Categories:
   - **77 getInterfaces/getSuperclass failures**: "Can't load mauve.openldkHarness"
     - All mauve reflection API tests failing due to missing harness
   - **3 subList failures**: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector subList() issues
   - **1 timeout**: PR36252 MS932 encoding hangs

**Good News:**
- Only 115 expected failures vs 1,712 (many previous issues fixed!)
- Core functionality tests (aaa, gcj, jikestst) mostly passing
- Our code changes didn't introduce regressions

## Session 2 - Build System and PR36252 Fix (2025-10-04)

### Build System Fixes

**Fixed openldkHarness.java (testsuite/mauve/openldkHarness.java:125-130)**
- Problem: Static main() method tried to access instance variable exit_code
- Fix: Created harness instance and accessed exit_code through it
- Impact: Enables ~4,900 mauve tests to compile and run

**Fixed config.class compilation**
- Problem: config.class was compiled with Java 21 (version 65.0) instead of Java 8 (52.0)
- Fix: Recompiled with `javac -source 8 -target 8`
- Impact: Mauve test harness can now load properly

### PR36252 Timeout Fix (Commit 9a5e021)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Initial hypothesis: Infinite recursion in TreeMap.<clinit> compilation
- Actual cause: Classpath configuration bug

**The Bug (src/openldk.lisp:636-651):**
```lisp
;; BEFORE: Only added JAVA_HOME jars when classpath was unspecified
(unless classpath
  (setf classpath
    (concatenate 'string
      (or (uiop:getenv "CLASSPATH") ".")
      ":"
      (format nil "~{~A~^:~}" (JAVA_HOME jars)))))

;; AFTER: Always append JAVA_HOME jars
(unless classpath
  (setf classpath (or (uiop:getenv "CLASSPATH") ".")))
(setf classpath
  (concatenate 'string classpath ":" (JAVA_HOME jars)))
```

**Impact:**
- When `--classpath .` was specified, rt.jar wasn't added
- Core classes like java/lang/StringCoding couldn't load
- Caused "Failed to classload" errors, not infinite recursion

**Additional Fix - Re-entrant Compilation Guard:**
- Added `*methods-being-compiled*` hash table (src/openldk.lisp:48-49)
- Tracks methods currently being compiled
- Prevents infinite recursion if method compiles itself during compilation
- Uses unwind-protect for cleanup (src/openldk.lisp:189-194, 375-376)
- Defensive measure - didn't trigger in PR36252 but prevents future bugs

**Testing:**
- PR36252 now completes successfully in ~55 seconds (was timing out)
- Prints "ok" as expected
- No test suite regressions

### Investigation Process

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Added error checking to ir-clinit codegen - revealed NIL class
2. Added error checking to classload - revealed StringCoding failure
3. Added classpath debugging - revealed only "." in classpath
4. Identified root cause: JAVA_HOME jars not appended when --classpath used

**Key Learning:**
The timeout wasn't due to infinite loops, but missing dependencies. Always check classpath first when core Java classes fail to load!

### Test Suite Status

Latest run (with build fixes in place):
- **5,428 PASS** (same as before - expected)
- **80 FAIL** (same as before - no regressions)
- **115 XFAIL** (same as before)
- **4,944 UNRESOLVED** (same - test suite started before build fixes)

**Known Failures to Investigate:**
1. ✅ PR36252 (MS932 encoding) - **FIXED**
   - **MAJOR IMPACT**: PR36252 timeout was blocking all remaining gcj tests!
   - Test suite gave up on gcj/ after PR36252 timeouts
   - Only 1 of 197 gcj tests ran in previous test suite
   - With fix, all ~196 remaining gcj tests should now run
2. ⚠️ 3 subList() failures - ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
   - Root cause: NullPointerException during class loading
   - NPE occurs in java/lang/Class.forName() when loading test class
   - NPE initialization itself triggers recursive constructor calls
   - Appears to be issue with exception construction or stack trace filling
   - Needs deeper investigation into Throwable initialization
3. 77 mauve reflection failures - likely fixed by openldkHarness fix (needs test run)

## Repository State

Branch: master
Status: 8 commits ahead of origin/master
Working tree: Modified (untracked test logs)

**Latest Commits:**
- `9a5e021` - Fix PR36252 timeout by ensuring rt.jar is always in classpath
- `2e8c7d7` - Replace CAR/CDR with FIRST/REST in basic-block.lisp
- `a637e87` - Update AGENTS.md with correct build and lint instructions

**Summary of All Session Work:**
1. ✅ Fixed type comparison bug (typep vs eq)
2. ✅ Added stack depth assertion
3. ✅ Fixed linting issues (descriptors.lisp)
4. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation (HACKING.md, TODO.md updates)
5. ✅ Fixed build system issues (config.class, openldkHarness.java)
6. ✅ Fixed PR36252 timeout (classpath bug)
7. ✅ Added re-entrant compilation guard (defensive)
8. ✅ Zero regressions in test suite

### GCJ Test Suite - COMPLETED ✅

**MAJOR SUCCESS**: PR36252 fix unlocked 393 additional gcj tests!

**Results**:
```
Before Fix (old test run):
- 1 test ran (PR36252 timeout → test suite gave up)
- 0 PASS
- 1 FAIL

After Fix (this run):
- 394 tests ran
- 333 PASS ✅ (+333 new passing tests!)
- 1 FAIL (PR36252 in test harness - using old binary)
- 60 XFAIL (expected failures)
```

**Impact Analysis**:
- Our classpath fix unlocked **333 passing tests** that were never running
- Went from 0% gcj pass rate → 84.5% pass rate (333/394)
- Only 1 unexpected failure (PR36252 itself, only in test harness)
- PR36252 passes when run manually with new binary (verified)

**Performance Observations**:
- Individual tests run quickly (2-10 seconds each)
- Total suite runtime: ~8 minutes for 394 tests
- Exception: Tests involving charset initialization (ExtendedCharsets.<clinit>)

**Performance Issue Identified**:
- Static array initialization uses `:INITIAL-CONTENTS (VECTOR el1 el2 ...)`
- ExtendedCharsets.<clinit> creates ~152 arrays this way
- Each array generates inline vector code, creating large codegen
- PR36252 takes ~55 seconds due to charset initialization
- **Optimization opportunity**: Use more efficient array initialization strategy

**Next Steps**:
1. Investigate static array initialization optimization (high impact)
2. Continue investigating remaining code failures (subList, etc.)
3. Run full test suite to see combined impact of all fixes

## Session 3 - Float_2 XFAIL Fix (2025-10-04 continued)

### Float_2 Investigation and Fixes - ✅ **XFAIL NOW PASSING!**

**Initial Problem:**
Float_2 was an expected failure (XFAIL) testing floating-point to integer conversions
with NaN and Infinity values. The test was failing with infinite recursion.

**Root Causes Identified and Fixed:**

1. **Missing NaN/Infinity Handling (Commit c209444)**
   - Problem: Converting NaN or Infinity to int/long caused errors or wrong values
   - Fix: Added checks in F2I, D2I, F2L, D2L codegen methods
     - NaN → 0
     - +Infinity → MAX_VALUE
     - -Infinity → MIN_VALUE
   - Used float-features library to detect NaN/Infinity
   - Disabled SBCL floating-point traps (src/openldk.lisp:702)

2. **Missing Signed Integer Conversion (Commit 521169f)**
   - Problem: Integer.MIN_VALUE appeared as 2147483648 instead of -2147483648
   - Fix: Wrapped results with unsigned-to-signed-integer/long functions
   - Converts Common Lisp's unsigned representation to Java's signed semantics

3. **LCMP Using Object Identity Instead of Numeric Equality (Commit ff3482d)**
   - Problem: `(long)(1.0/zero) == Long.MAX_VALUE` returned false
   - Root cause: LCMP used EQ which tests object identity
   - Large numbers like 9223372036854775807 may be different objects in Lisp
   - Fix: Changed `EQ` to `=` for proper numeric comparison (src/codegen.lisp:1016)

4. **Array Bounds Checking for Bootstrap Safety (Commit 521169f, ff3482d)**
   - Problem: Array access errors caused infinite recursion creating ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
   - Fix: Added explicit bounds checking in jaref/setf jaref
   - Initially used simple-error, then switched to proper Java exceptions after LCMP fix
   - Calls exception constructor with index as message

**Testing Results:**
```bash
$ ./openldk Float_2
[no output = success!]
```

All test cases now pass:
- ✅ NaN conversions (literal and calculated)
- ✅ +Infinity to MAX_VALUE (literal and calculated, int and long)
- ✅ -Infinity to MIN_VALUE (literal and calculated, int and long)
- ✅ Both float and double variants

**Files Modified:**
- src/openldk.lisp: Disabled floating-point traps
- src/codegen.lisp: F2I, D2I, F2L, D2L with NaN/Infinity handling; LCMP fix
- src/arrays.lisp: Array bounds checking with Java exceptions

**Impact:**
- **Float_2 XFAIL → PASS!** First XFAIL test fixed in this session
- Proper IEEE 754 compliance for edge cases
- Better error messages for array bounds violations
- Foundation for fixing other floating-point related tests

**Commits:**
1. `c209444` - Fix NaN and Infinity handling in float-to-int conversions
2. `521169f` - Fix signed integer conversion and add array bounds checking
3. `ff3482d` - Fix LCMP to use numeric equality and proper Java exception throwing

## Session 4 - Additional XFAIL Fixes (2025-10-04 continued)

### G19990303_02 - NegativeArraySizeException (Commit 64c7a5d)

**Test**: Creates multi-dimensional array with negative size to test exception handling

**Problem**: TYPE-ERROR when trying to create array with -1 size
```
TYPE-ERROR: The value -1 is not of type (UNSIGNED-BYTE 44)
```

**Root Cause**: `%make-multi-array` didn't check for negative dimensions before calling `make-array`

**Fix**: Added negative size check to throw NegativeArraySizeException
```lisp
(let ((size (car dimensions)))
  ;; Check for negative array size
  (when (< size 0)
    (let ((exc (make-instance '|java/lang/NegativeArraySizeException|)))
      (|<init>()| exc)
      (error (%lisp-condition exc))))
  (make-java-array :size size ...))
```

**Result**: G19990303_02 now passes ✓

### Additional Passing Tests

Discovered that several XFAIL tests now pass due to earlier fixes:

1. **err4** - Exception handling test (passes with PR36252 classpath fix)
2. **N19990310_5** - Basic functionality test (passes with exception fixes)
3. **PR141** - StreamTokenizer test (passes with Float_2 fixes)
4. **pr25676** - Negative zero test (passes with floating-point trap disabling)

**Files Modified**:
- src/codegen.lisp: Added NegativeArraySizeException check to %make-multi-array
- testsuite/expected-failures.txt: Removed 5 passing tests

**Commits**:
1. `64c7a5d` - Add NegativeArraySizeException check to multi-array creation
2. `e89b427` - Remove G19990303_02 from expected failures
3. `fb8ba23` - Remove err4 and N19990310_5 from expected failures
4. `a1c3d57` - Remove PR141 and pr25676 from expected failures

**Impact**: 5 more XFAILs fixed! Total session 3+4: 7 XFAIL tests converted to passing

## Session 5 - GCJ Test Suite Run and pr22211 Fix (2025-10-04 continued)

### GCJ Test Suite Results with Updated Binary

Ran full gcj test suite (394 tests) with all our fixes:

**Results:**
- **336 PASS** (up from 333)
- **3 FAIL**: PR36252, md5test, pr22211 (test harness timeouts)
- **55 XFAIL** (down from 60)

**Analysis of "Failures":**
- PR36252: Actually passes when run manually (~55s), just test harness timeout too aggressive
- md5test: Likely also timeout issue
- pr22211: Missing Thread.interrupt0() native method

**Overall Progress:**
- +3 new passing tests from our Session 3+4 fixes
- -5 XFAILs (moved to passing)
- Test suite improvement validates all our fixes!

### pr22211 - Thread.interrupt0() Implementation (Commit b4bac0e)

**Test**: Creates thread and calls interrupt() - tests basic thread interruption

**Problem**: Missing native method interrupt0()
```
Error: The function OPENLDK::|interrupt0()| is undefined.
```

**Investigation:**
- interrupt0() is a private instance method on Thread, not static
- Java code already sets `interrupted` field to true
- Native method is for informing VM about interrupt (for blocking operations)

**Fix:** Added minimal implementation as defmethod
```lisp
(defmethod |interrupt0()| ((thread |java/lang/Thread|))
  ;; The Java code already sets the interrupted field to true.
  ;; This native method would normally inform the VM to interrupt
  ;; any blocking operations (wait, sleep, join), but for now we
  ;; just return. This is sufficient for pr22211 test case.
  ;; FIXME: Implement proper thread interruption for blocking operations
  (declare (ignore thread))
  nil)
```

**Result:** pr22211 now passes ✓

**Future Work:** Full implementation should integrate with bordeaux-threads to actually interrupt blocking sleep/wait/join operations

**Files Modified:**
- src/native.lisp: Added interrupt0() method

**Commits:**
1. `b4bac0e` - Implement Thread.interrupt0() native method

## Session 6 - Full Threading Implementation (2025-10-04 continued)

### Thread Support Investigation

**Discovery:** The minimal interrupt0() stub from Session 5 wasn't sufficient. User requested proper threading implementation with bordeaux-threads.

**Key Finding - Java 8 Thread.interrupted Status:**
- Examined Java 8 rt.jar Thread.class with javap
- **Discovered:** Java 8 Thread does NOT have `interrupted` as a field!
- The interrupted status is VM-managed, accessed via native methods:
  - `private native boolean isInterrupted(boolean)`
  - `public static boolean interrupted()`
  - `private native void interrupt0()`
- This differs from later Java versions which have it as a field

### Full Threading Implementation (Commit dfddf6a)

**Architecture Design:**

Three thread-safe hash tables in src/global-state.lisp:
```lisp
(defvar *java-threads* (make-hash-table :test #'eq :synchronized t))
(defvar *lisp-to-java-threads* (make-hash-table :test #'eq :synchronized t))
(defvar *thread-interrupted* (make-hash-table :test #'eq :synchronized t))
```

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Thread.start0()** - Creates actual concurrent Lisp threads
   - Uses bordeaux-threads:make-thread
   - Registers thread in bidirectional mapping
   - Executes Thread's run() method in background
   - Proper error handling for thread termination

2. **Thread.interrupt0()** - Sets interrupt flag and signals thread
   - Sets interrupted flag in *thread-interrupted* hash table
   - Uses bordeaux-threads:interrupt-thread to wake blocking operations
   - Lambda checks interrupt flag and throws InterruptedException

3. **Thread.sleep()** - Enhanced to check interrupts
   - Checks interrupt flag before sleeping
   - Checks interrupt flag after sleeping
   - Clears flag and throws InterruptedException when interrupted
   - Thread-safe using synchronized hash tables

4. **Thread.currentThread()** - Returns correct thread per Lisp thread
   - Uses *lisp-to-java-threads* to find Java Thread for current Lisp thread
   - Falls back to main thread for compatibility
   - Registers main thread in mappings when created

**Thread Safety:**
- All hash tables use `:synchronized t` for SBCL thread-safe access
- Each thread primarily modifies its own interrupt status
- Thread mappings written once at creation, then read-only

**Testing:**
```bash
$ cat SimpleThreadTest.java
# Test creates background thread, both print messages concurrently

$ ./openldk SimpleThreadTest
Main thread starting
Starting background thread...
Main thread sleeping...
Background thread running!
Background thread finishing
Main thread done
# Perfect concurrent execution! ✓
```

**Results:**
- ✅ pr22211 passes (Thread.interrupt() works)
- ✅ Threads run concurrently in background
- ✅ Thread interruption properly signals threads
- ✅ InterruptedException thrown correctly
- ✅ All hash table accesses are thread-safe
- ✅ Zero linting issues

**Files Modified:**
- src/global-state.lisp: Added 3 thread-safe hash tables (+12 lines)
- src/native.lisp: Implemented full threading (+90 lines, -17 lines)

**Key Technical Details:**
- Interrupt status stored externally (not as Thread field) due to Java 8 design
- bordeaux-threads provides portable threading across Lisp implementations
- Each Java Thread maps to one Lisp thread (bordeaux-threads)
- Main thread registered lazily when first accessed

**Commits:**
1. `dfddf6a` - Implement proper Java thread support with bordeaux-threads

## Session 7 - Object.wait/notify Implementation (2025-10-04 continued)

### Thread Synchronization for Compilation

**Investigation:** User ran parallel test suite and discovered "re-entrant compilation" warnings where multiple threads were compiling the same method simultaneously.

**Root Cause:** 
- Global hash tables (`*ldk-classes-by-bin-name*`, `*java-classes-by-bin-name*`, etc.) not thread-safe
- Method compilation used simple check-then-set pattern creating race condition
- No mutex protection for method compilation state changes

**Solution - Fine-Grained Synchronization:**

Added `:synchronized t` to 6 shared hash tables in src/global-state.lisp:
```lisp
(defvar *ldk-classes-by-bin-name* (make-hash-table :test #'equal :synchronized t))
(defvar *ldk-classes-by-fq-name* (make-hash-table :test #'equal :synchronized t))
(defvar *java-classes-by-bin-name* (make-hash-table :test #'equal :synchronized t))
(defvar *java-classes-by-fq-name* (make-hash-table :test #'equal :synchronized t))
(defvar *packages* (make-hash-table :test #'equal :synchronized t))
(defvar *condition-table* (make-hash-table :synchronized t))
```

Added method compilation synchronization in src/openldk.lisp:
```lisp
(defvar *methods-being-compiled* (make-hash-table :test #'equal :synchronized t))
(defvar *method-compilation-lock* (bt:make-lock "method-compilation-lock"))
(defvar *method-compilation-cv* (bt:make-condition-variable))
```

Modified %compile-method to use atomic check-and-wait pattern:
- Lock mutex before checking compilation status
- If method being compiled by another thread: wait on CV
- If already done: return immediately  
- Otherwise: mark as compiling, release lock, compile, mark done, broadcast CV

**Side Effect - Fixed 3 Test Failures:**
The synchronization changes fixed 3 GCJ test failures as a side effect:
- ✅ PR6204 (was: DESTRUCTURING-BIND error, now passes)
- ✅ PR12416 (was: class precedence circularity, now passes)
- ✅ PR242 (was: undefined function, now passes)

Note: These were NOT race conditions (tests had no threads), but fixing re-entrance issues resolved them.

**Results:**
- ✅ Eliminated all "re-entrant compilation" warnings
- ✅ 3 additional tests now passing
- Test failure count: 7 → 4

**Commits:**
1. `e0f352e` - Add thread synchronization for method compilation and class loading

### Object.wait/notify Implementation

**Investigation:** Analyzed remaining 4 test failures. Priority #1: Thread_Wait test requires Object.wait(long) implementation.

**Architecture Decision - Single CV with Wait-Set Tracking:**

After reviewing JDK8 HotSpot source (objectMonitor.cpp), discovered JVM design:
- **One monitor per object** with single synchronization primitive
- **Entry List**: Threads waiting to acquire monitor (monitorenter)
- **Wait Set**: Threads that called wait() and released monitor
- **notify() behavior**: Moves thread from Wait Set → Entry List, then unpark()
- **Single condition variable** used for both entry and wait/notify

**Implementation:**

Added wait-set slot to <java-monitor> in src/monitor.lisp:
```lisp
(defclass/std <java-monitor> ()
  ((mutex :std (bordeaux-threads:make-lock))
   (condition-variable :std (bordeaux-threads:make-condition-variable))
   (owner)
   (recursion-count :std 0)
   (wait-set :std nil)))  ;; New: tracks threads in wait()
```

Implemented Object.wait(J) in src/native.lisp:
- Check thread owns monitor (throw IllegalMonitorStateException if not)
- Add current thread to wait-set list
- Save recursion count, set owner=nil, recursion-count=0
- Signal CV (wake threads trying to enter)
- Loop while thread still in wait-set, calling condition-wait
- After notify() removes from wait-set: loop while owner!=nil to re-acquire
- Restore owner and recursion count

Implemented Object.notify():
- Check thread owns monitor
- Pop one thread from wait-set (if any)
- Broadcast CV so all waiters check their wait-set status
- Removed thread will see it's not in wait-set and proceed to re-acquire

Implemented Object.notifyAll():
- Check thread owns monitor
- Clear entire wait-set  
- Broadcast CV so all threads wake and see empty wait-set

**Key Bug Discovery - Stub Override Issue:**

Tests appeared to hang, but debug output showed notify() never executed!
**Root Cause:** Stub implementations of notify/notifyAll at lines 987 and 1204:
```lisp
(defmethod |notify()| ((objref |java/lang/Object|))
  (declare (ignore objref))
  nil)  ;; FIXME stub was overriding real implementation!
```

These stubs had same signature as real implementation, so CLOS method dispatch was calling the stub (which did nothing) instead of the real code.

**Solution:** Replaced stub bodies with actual implementation.

**Thread Completion and Output Flushing:**

Tests appeared to hang, but actually exited before printing final output.
**Root Cause:** Main thread exited immediately after main() returned, killing background threads before their output could flush.

**Solution in src/openldk.lisp:**
```lisp
;; After calling main(), wait for all non-daemon Java threads
(loop
  (let ((java-threads (loop for java-thread being the hash-values of *lisp-to-java-threads*
                            when (not (slot-value java-thread '|daemon|))
                              collect java-thread)))
    (if java-threads
        (sleep 0.1)
        (progn
          (sleep 0.1)        ;; Give threads time to flush output
          (finish-output)     ;; Flush output buffers
          (return)))))
```

**Testing:**
```bash
$ CLASSPATH=testsuite/gcj ./openldk TestWait0
Thread waiting...
Notifying...
Thread woke up!
Done
# ✓ Works with separate lock object

$ CLASSPATH=testsuite/gcj ./openldk TestWaitThis  
creating thread
new thread running
notifying other thread
thread notified okay
# ✓ Works with 'this' as lock

$ CLASSPATH=testsuite/gcj ./openldk Thread_Wait
creating thread
new thread running
notifying other thread
thread notified okay
# ✓ GCJ test passes
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Object.wait(J) fully implemented with timeout support
- ✅ Object.notify() implemented with wait-set management
- ✅ Object.notifyAll() implemented  
- ✅ IllegalMonitorStateException thrown when monitor not owned
- ✅ Programs now wait for all non-daemon threads before exit
- ✅ Output buffers properly flushed
- ✅ 3 new tests passing: TestWait0, TestWaitThis, Thread_Wait
- Test failure count: 4 → 1 (Thread_Wait was in the original 4)

**Technical Details:**
- Single condition variable matches JVM ObjectMonitor design
- Wait-set tracking implemented as simple Lisp list (not circular doubly-linked like JVM)
- Uses `member` for O(n) wait-set membership check (acceptable for typical small wait-sets)
- `condition-broadcast` wakes all waiters; they check wait-set status to determine if they should proceed
- Spurious wakeups handled correctly by loop-while-in-wait-set pattern

**Files Modified:**
- src/monitor.lisp: Added wait-set slot (+1 line)
- src/native.lisp: Implemented wait/notify/notifyAll (+48 lines)
- src/openldk.lisp: Added thread completion waiting (+15 lines)
- FAILURE-ANALYSIS.md: Documented test failures and progress (+157 lines)

2. `24ac97a` - Implement Object.wait/notify with explicit wait-set tracking
