<p>Each Contributor grants to YOU a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty
free license to make, use, sell, offer to sell or import the Program
for use in Licensed Code under any patents licensable by such
Contributor (but only to the extent such grant would not require

action against such Contributor for intellectual property
infringement.
